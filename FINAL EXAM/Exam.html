            <p> <span>Summary:</span> The Republic of San Magnolia. For a long time, this country has been besieged by its neighbor, the
                Giadian Empire, which created a series of unmanned drones called the Legion. After years of painstaking
                research, the Republic finally developed autonomous drones of their own, turning the one-sided struggle
                into a war without casualties—or at least, that's what the government claims. In truth, there is no such
                thing as a bloodless war. Beyond the fortified walls protecting the eighty-five Republic territories
                lies the "nonexistent" Eighty-Sixth Sector. The young men and women of this forsaken land are branded
                the Eighty-Six and, stripped of their humanity, pilot the "unmanned" weapons into battle... Shinn
                directs the actions of a detachment of young Eighty-Sixers while on the battlefield. Lena is a "handler"
                who commands the detachment from the remote rear with the help of special communication. The farewell
                story of the severe and sad struggle of these two begins!</p>

            <h2>Boruto: Naruto next generations</h2>
            <p> <span>Summary:</span> Naruto was a young shinobi with an incorrigible knack for mischief. He achieved his dream to become the
                greatest ninja in the village and his face sits atop the Hokage monument. But this is not his story... A
                new
                generation of ninja are ready to take the stage, led by Naruto's own son, Boruto!</p>

            <h2>Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu.</h2>
            <p> <span>Summary:</span> It's Shouko Komi's first day at the prestigious Itan Private High School, and she has already risen to
                the status of the school's Madonna. With long black hair and a tall, graceful appearance, she captures
                the attention of anyone who comes across her. There's just one problem though—despite her popularity,
                Shouko is terrible at communicating with others. Hitohito Tadano is your average high school boy. With
                his life motto of "read the situation and make sure to stay away from trouble," he quickly finds that
                sitting next to Shouko has made him the enemy of everyone in his class! One day, knocked out by
                accident, Hitohito later wakes up to the sound of Shouko's "meow." He lies that he heard nothing,
                causing Shouko to run away. But before she can escape, Hitohito surmises that Shouko is not able to talk
                to others easily—in fact, she has never been able to make a single friend. Hitohito resolves to help
                Shouko with her goal of making one hundred friends so that she can overcome her communication disorder.

            <h2>Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha, Isekai Kizoku ni Tensei suru</h2>
            <p> <span>Summary:</span> 'm going to live for myself!" The greatest assassin on Earth knew only how to live as a tool for his
                employers—until they stopped letting him live. Reborn by the grace of a goddess into a world of swords
                and sorcery, he's offered a chance to do things differently this time around, but there's a catch...He
                has to eliminate a super-powerful hero who will bring about the end of the world unless he is stopped.
                Now known as Lugh Tuatha Dé, the master assassin certainly has his hands full, particularly because of
                all the beautiful girls who constantly surround him. Lugh may have been an incomparable killer, but how
                will he fare against foes with powerful magic?</p>

                the D2. They are young women who hold the power of music, the "Musicart." These young women hold
                "scores" that are able to defeat the monsters. And there are also people who lead these women, the
