    <h2>HTML 2</h2>
    <p>November 24,1995</p>
    <p>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</p>
    <!--'<ul>'=unordered list. '<li>'=list. -->
    <ul>
        <li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1866 (form-based file upload)</li>
        <li>May 1996:RFC 1942 (tables)</li>
        <li><del>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</del></li>
        <li>January 1997:RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>HTML 3</h2>
    <p>January 14, 1997</p>
    <p>HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized
        exclusively by the W3C, as the EITF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996. </p>

    <h2>HTML 4</h2>
    <p>December 18,1997</p>
    <p>HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:</p>
    <!--'<ol>'=ordered list.-->
    <ol>
        <li><b>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</b></li>
        <li><i>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</i></li>
        <li><ins>Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</ins></li>
    </ol>
    <i>Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at
        the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. 
        <ins>HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 - SGML</ins>
